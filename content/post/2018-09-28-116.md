description: "<p>This came up in response to a student&#8217;s question. I wrote that,
  in general, you can plot a function y(x) on a simple graph. You can plot y(x,x2)
  by plotting y vs x and then having several lines showing different values of x2
  (for example, x2=0, x2=0.5, x2=1, x2=1.5, x2=2, etc). You can plot y(x,x2,x3,x4)

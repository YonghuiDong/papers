          <p>Recently I received a few bug reports about the PDF generation in R Markdown. Eventually I figured out one of the reasons: spaces in filenames. For example, in <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1285">rstudio/rmarkdown#1285</a>, <code>xelatex</code> failed to compile the <code>.tex</code> file because there was a space in a folder name (but <code>pdflatex</code> succeeded). From this issue, you can also see how many replies it takes to get <a href="https://yihui.name/en/2017/09/the-minimal-reprex-paradox/">a reproducible example</a>.</p>

  <p>I had been bothered by spaces for long enough before (not only in LaTeX), so I had developed a habit of not using spaces in any of my filenames. When I need to separate words, I always use dashes (<code>-</code>) instead of other characters such as underscores (<code>_</code>) or dots (<code>.</code>). I have no idea why spaces are bad in file paths in LaTeX. In HTML, spaces in file paths are often encoded to <code>%20</code>. In command line, when a path contains spaces, it has to be quoted (e.g., <code>rm &quot;abc def.txt&quot;</code>). For underscores, they are special characters in LaTeX (e.g., in the math mode, an underscore indicates a subscript). By comparison, dashes are much safer everywhere, and they are not special characters in HTML or LaTeX.</p>

  <p>For the same reason, I always recommend <strong>knitr</strong> and R Markdown users to use dashes in chunk labels instead of spaces or underscores, e.g., this is good:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-markdown">```{r, hello-world, fig.width=8}
  ```
  </code></pre>

  <p>These could be bad chunk labels:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-markdown">```{r, hello world, fig.width=8}
  ```

  ```{r, hello_world, fig.width=8}
  ```
  </code></pre>

  <p>Chunk labels will be used to name figure files (if any plots are generated in the code chunk), so you have to use more portable characters in the labels. Usually I only use letters a-z, A-Z, numbers 0-9, and dashes.

description: 'My previous post looked at Jacobi functions from a reference perspective:
  given a Jacobi function defined one way, how do I relate that to the same function
  defined another way, and how would you compute it? This post explores the analogy
  between trigonometric functions and Jacobi elliptic functions. Related basic Jacobi
  functions to trig functions [&#8230;]'

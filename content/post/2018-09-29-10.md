description: John Baez left a comment on my post on group statistics saying It’s known
  that the number of groups of order p^n for prime p is p^{2n^3/27+O(n^(8/3))}. It
  might be fun to compare this to what Mathematica says. Here goes. First let&#8217;s
  let p = 2. Mathematica&#8217;s FiniteGroupCount function tops out at n = 10. And

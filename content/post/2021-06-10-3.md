description: "\n        \n\n<p>Last year I came across <a href=\"https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-09-07-introducing-the-rstudio-ide-and-r-markdown/\">a
  wonderful post by Shannon\nPileggi</a>,\nin which she demonstrated a large number
  of super useful tips about R Markdown\nwith GIFs. One of them caught my attention
  especially, which is,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let your markdown <strong>breathe</strong>!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She
  meant that you may try to add blank lines into your Markdown text when\nsomething
  does"

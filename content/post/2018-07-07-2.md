  never be possible to me again, but today I reached a goal of &ldquo;Issue Zero&rdquo;
  for the Github repo <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rticles\">rstudio/rticles</a>.
  I have to say this is so rare. In fact, it is the very first time I have been able
  to close <em>all</em> issues in a Github repo.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/42387508-1158fcbc-8108-11e8-8e09-7fe979ac1a13.png#border\"

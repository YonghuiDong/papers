description: The US uses a mix of imperial and metric units of measure. Some people,
  almost all outside the US, are quite agitated by this. In practice, the two systems
  coexist peacefully. Americans buy milk by the gallon and wine by the milliliter.
  Milk typically comes in gallon jugs, and wine typically comes in 750 milliliter

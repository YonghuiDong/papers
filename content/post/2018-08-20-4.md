description: This year&#8217;s census already been the subject of some news reports,
  some of which have quoted me.  I&#8217;ve now been appointed to an external data
  quality panel advising StatsNZ,  and I will be much more limited in what I can say
  in the future here or to journalists.  That&#8217;s partly just ordinary confidentiality
  to make [&#8230;]

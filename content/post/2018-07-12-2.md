          <p>As a software developer, I prefer lightweight stuff and avoid dependencies when possible. Over the years, I have been leaning more and more towards &ldquo;frugality&rdquo;. I used to be big fan of libraries like jQuery and FontAwesome, but now I rarely use them any more. I started to write vanilla JavaScript after I suddently discovered <code>document.querySelector()</code> one day (before that, I thought <code>$()</code> was the only way to select a node in the world).</p>

description: "\n        <p>My friend Miao is going to finish his postdoctoral research
  in Waterloo this summer. Currently he is looking for a new postdoc position in the
  US (no particular preference over the location in US). I&rsquo;m trying to help
  him here because usually I love helping talents who are not widely known (of course,
  famous people won&rsquo;t need my help, either).</p>\n\n<p>Miao&rsquo;s background
  is environmental science, about which I know nothing, but we do have one strong
  interest in common: reproducible research. His R skills are pretty impressive to
  me, and he is also a creative R programmer. He has some interesting thoughts on
  open and reproducible journals, which is also something I have been interested in
  for years.</p>\n\n<p>You can learn more about him from his vitae at <a href=\"https://yufree.cn/en/vitae/\">https://yufree.cn/en/vitae/</a>.
  He has been blogging for a number of years, which is perhaps an even better way
  to know more about him. Please let him know if you have an open position this summer.
  Thanks!</p>\n\n        \n        <script>location.href='https://yihui.name/en/2018/03/miao-yu-postdoc/';</script>\n

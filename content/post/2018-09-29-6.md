description: Fermat&#8217;s little theorem says that if p is a prime and a is not
  a multiple of p, then ap-1 = 1 (mod p). Euler&#8217;s generalization of Fermat&#8217;s
  little theorem says that if a is relatively prime to m, then aφ(m) = 1 (mod m) where
  φ(m) is Euler&#8217;s so-called totient function. This function counts the number
  of positive [&#8230;]

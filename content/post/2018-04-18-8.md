description: 'An &#8216;insufficient data&#8217; edition Data quality matters: the
  high rate of death reported for women giving birth in Texas seems to have been partly
  a data entry error.  Researchers say Approximately half (50.3%) of obstetric-coded
  deaths showed no evidence of pregnancy within 42 days, and a large majority of these
  incorrectly indicated pregnancy at the time [&#8230;]'

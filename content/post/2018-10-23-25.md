  I am tired of searching compounds online. So far, more than 140 Millons substances have been registered for CAS registry number. However, it doesn&rsquo;t mean CAS has covered all the compounds. In fact, at least three identifiers have been used to let someone find the compounds&rsquo; information online.
  The first one is CAS registry number. This number is quiet useful to buy standards. However, it&rsquo;s not free to get access to the full list of CAS registry number.

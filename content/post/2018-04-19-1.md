  <p>Regarding this paper, Frank Harrell writes: One grammatical correction: Alvan Feinstein, the &#8216;father of clinical epidemiology&#8217; at Yale, educated me about &#8216;trichotomy&#8217;. dichotomous = Greek dicho (two) + tomous (cut). Three = tri so the proper word would be &#8216;tritomous&#8217; instead of &#8216;trichotomous&#8217;. Uh oh. I can&#8217;t bring myself to use the word &#8220;tritomous&#8221; as [&#8230;]</p>

description: If you know the vertices of a polygon, how do you compute its area? This
  seems like this could be a complicated, with special cases for whether the polygon
  is convex or maybe other considerations. But as long as the polygon is &#8220;simple,&#8221;
  i.e. the sides meet at vertices but otherwise do not intersect each [&#8230;]

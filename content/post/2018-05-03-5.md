description: "\n        \n\n<p>Last week I saw a fantastic post written by Jay Hanlon
  from Stack Overflow titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/\">Stack
  Overflow Isn’t Very Welcoming. It’s Time for That to Change</a>&rdquo;. I wanted
  to stand up in front of my computer and applaud for five minutes after reading this
  post. It is great that Stack Overflow was admitting the problem publicly and showing
  the intention to fix it.</p>\n"

description: 'For each prime p, there is only one group with p elements, the cyclic
  group with that many elements. It would be plausible to think there is only one
  group of order n if and only if n is prime, but this isn&#8217;t the case. If p
  and q are primes, then there are ostensibly at least two groups of order pq: [&#8230;]'

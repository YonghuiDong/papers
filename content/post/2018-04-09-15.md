          <p>Last year at rstudio::conf 2017, I said I used the &ldquo;conference-driven development model&rdquo;. Right before I gave the talk on <strong>blogdown</strong>, I wrote an RStudio addin to demonstrate in my talk, which later evolved into the &ldquo;New Post&rdquo; addin you see today. I really meant the &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/970841704625356801">talk-driven development</a>&ldquo;: when I&rsquo;m going to give a talk, I&rsquo;ll surely ask myself how I could make better use of the unique chance to show something exciting to the audience.</p>

  <p>This year, I thought about the same thing before I gave the talk at rstudio::conf, but didn&rsquo;t risk writing new code right before my talk (sigh, I&rsquo;m becoming old and my brain is becoming slow). I mentioned a tiny feature <a href="https://slides.yihui.name/2018-blogdown-rstudio-conf-Yihui-Xie.html#22"><code>options(blogdown.title_case = TRUE)</code></a> in my talk, which was a <strong>blogdown</strong> feature I added two days before the talk. When you set this option, your post title will be converted to title case if the post is created via the &ldquo;New Post&rdquo; addin in RStudio or <code>blogdown::new_post()</code>, thanks to the function <code>tools::toTitleCase()</code>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:As-you-all-know"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:As-you-all-know">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>The number of my own blog posts has been skyrocketing after I (pretty much) finished developing the <strong>blogdown</strong> package last year. I write a lot of posts and use title case myself, but I have two pains: (1) Sometimes I&rsquo;m not sure if I should capitalize the initial letter of a word or not; (2) I don&rsquo;t enjoy holding the <code>Shift</code> key to type capitals. I had thought about <code>tools::toTitleCase()</code> but was too lazy to implement it in <strong>blogdown</strong>, and the upcoming talk at the conference was an excellent motivation.</p>

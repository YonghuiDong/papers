description: TheÂ Jacobi elliptic functions sn and cn are analogous to the trigonometric
  functions sine and cosine. The come up in applications such as nonlinear oscillations
  and conformal mapping. Unfortunately there are multiple conventions for defining
  these functions. The purpose of this post is to clear up the confusion around these
  different conventions. The image above is [&#8230;]

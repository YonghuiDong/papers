  <p>After more than a decade of effort, researchers have identified the likely structure of the protonated serine octamer, an unusual complex first observed by mass spectrometry almost 20 years ago. Researchers used a combination of computer modeling and advanced infrared spectrometry to confirm this molecular arrangement. The newly reported structure is the first that explains [&#8230;]</p>

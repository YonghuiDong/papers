description: I&#8217;ve mentioned a couple times that Jacobi elliptic functions are
  generalizations of sines and cosines. In an earlier post I showed how you can make
  sn and cn from sine and cosine by a nonlinear rescaling of the input. In this post
  I&#8217;ll look at a linear scaling of the input and a sum of sines or [&#8230;]

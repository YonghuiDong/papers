  <p>Someone who graduated from collage a couple years ago writes: My educational background is almost entirely science and math. However, since graduating and thinking about what I do, I&#8217;ve realized that I&#8217;ve always found demographics, geography, urban planning more interesting &#8211; and I&#8217;d like to pursue research in social science. I&#8217;m currently applying to MS [&#8230;]</p>

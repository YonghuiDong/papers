description: "\n        \n\n<p>In the post &ldquo;<a href=\"https://yihui.name/en/2018/02/career-crisis/\">My
  Early Career Crisis</a>&rdquo; earlier this year, I promised that I&rsquo;d write
  a follow-up post to talk about my thoughts and advice for managers and fresh PhDs.
  This is the major &ldquo;debt&rdquo; I owe you before I can focus on my next project.
  I thought I&rsquo;d better pay it off now, so I can have something new to talk about
  at rstudio::conf 2019.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:Again-this-is-t"

description: The growing internet concern (IC) over the crude oil market and related
  events influences market trading, thus creating further instability within the oil
  market itself. We propose a modeling framework for analyzing the effects of IC on
  the oil market and for predicting the price volatility of crude oilâ€™s futures market.
  This novel approach decomposes the original time series into intrinsic modes at
  different time scales using bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD).<img src="http://feeds.

          <p>This morning I announced <a href="https://twitter.com/rstudio/status/1022865820869976065">the first <strong>bookdown</strong> contest</a>. I wished to launch this contest last year but hadn&rsquo;t had a chance. Basically I was hoping to encourage <strong>bookdown</strong> users to share their templates and examples, so that other people can reuse them. One motivation was writing academic dissertations. I really wish graduate students won&rsquo;t need to waste too much time on format

description: Forecast reconciliation involves adjusting forecasts to ensure coherence
  with aggregation constraints. We extend this concept from point forecasts to probabilistic
  forecasts by redefining forecast reconciliation in terms of linear functions in
  general, and projections more specifically. New theorems establish that the true
  predictive distribution can be recovered in the elliptical case by linear reconciliation,
  and general conditions are derived for when this is a projection. A geometric interpr

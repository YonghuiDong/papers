description: Sturm&#8217;s separation theorem says that the zeros of independent solutions
  to an equation of the form alternate. That is, between any two consecutive zeros
  of one solution, there is exactly one zero of the other solution. This is an important
  theorem because a lot of differential equations of this form come up in applications.

          <p>When you want to output a character vector for humans to read, you probably don&rsquo;t want something like <code>[1] a b c</code>, which is the normal way to print a vector in R. Instead, you may want a character string <code>&quot;a, b, and c&quot;</code> (Oxford comma FTW!). In 2014, I gave a guest lecture in a course at Iowa State. I prepared an example in which I wanted to output the names of some genes dynamically with an inline R expression in a <strong>knitr</strong> document

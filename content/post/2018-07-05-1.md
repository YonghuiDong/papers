  <p>James Coyne pointed me with distress or annoyance to this new paper, &#8220;Tutorial: The Practical Application of Longitudinal Structural Equation Mediation Models in Clinical Trials,&#8221; by K. A. Goldsmith, D. P. MacKinnon, T. Chalder, P. D. White, M. Sharpe, and A. Pickles. This is the team behind the PACE trial for systemic exercise intolerance disease. [&#8230;]</p>

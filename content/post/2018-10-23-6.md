description: The first time you see matrices, if someone asked you how you multiply
  two matrices together, your first idea might be to multiply every element of the
  first matrix by the element in the same position of the corresponding matrix, analogous
  to the way you add matrices. But that&#8217;s not usually how we multiply matrices.

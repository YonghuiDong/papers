description: Suppose you have two baseball teams, A and B, playing in the World Series.
  If you like, say A stands for Houston Astros and B for Milwaukee Brewers. Suppose
  that in each game the probability that A wins is p, and the probability of A losing
  is q = 1 &#8211; p. What is the probability that A will win the series? [&#8230;]

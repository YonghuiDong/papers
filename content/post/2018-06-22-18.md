          <p>Not surprisingly, <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org">HTML widgets</a> were designed for HTML output formats (e.g., <code>rmarkdown::html_document</code> and <code>rmarkdown::ioslides_presentation</code>). Their interactivity relies on JavaScript. In general, you should not expect JavaScript to work in LaTeX/PDF or Word or PowerPoint.</p>

  <p>In January 2015, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV4gtARPvu8">I gave an introductory talk</a> on HTML widgets in the LA R User Group.

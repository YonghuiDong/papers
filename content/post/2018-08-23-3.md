description: The explosion of time series data in recent years has brought a flourish
  of new time series analysis methods, for forecasting, clustering, classification
  and other tasks. The evaluation of these new methods requires a diverse collection
  of time series data to enable reliable comparisons against alternative approaches.
  We propose the use of mixture autoregressive (MAR) models to generate collections
  of time series with diverse features. We simulate sets of time series using MAR
  models and investi

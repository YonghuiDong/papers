description: There&#8217;s a story about Lotto on Stuff that starts off promisingly
  Forty Kiwis took out Lotto First Division on Wednesday night &#8211; the most first
  division winners in a single draw in the game&#8217;s 30-year-history. With that
  many winners sharing the $1 million prize, they&#8217;re only getting $25,000 each.
  This is one of the big reasons [&#8230;]

description: Many encryption algorithms rely on the difficulty of factoring a large
  number n. If you want to make n hard to factor, you want it to have only two factors.
  Otherwise, the more factors n has, the smaller the smallest factor must be. So if
  you want n to be the product of two large primes, p and q, you want [&#8230;]

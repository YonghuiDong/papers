  <p>Some people pointed me to this article, &#8220;Issues with data and analyses: Errors, underlying themes, and potential solutions,&#8221; by Andrew Brown, Kathryn Kaiser, and David Allison. They discuss &#8220;why focusing on errors [in science] is important,&#8221; &#8220;underlying themes of errors and their contributing factors, &#8220;the prevalence and consequences of errors,&#8221; and &#8220;how to improve conditions [&#8230;]</p>

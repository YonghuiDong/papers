description: "\n        \n        \n\n<p>Data == knowledge! Much of the data we use,
  whether it be from\ngovernment repositories, social media, GitHub, or e-commerce
  sites comes\nfrom public-facing APIs. The quantity of data available is truly\nstaggering,
  but munging JSON output into a format that is easily\nanalyzable in R is an equally
  staggering undertaking. When JSON is\nturned into an R object, it usually becomes
  a deeply nested list riddled\nwith missing values that is difficult to untangle
  into a tidy format.\nM"

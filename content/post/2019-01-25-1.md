description: "\n        \n\n<p>There was an obvious reason for me being quiet in my
  blog this month: the rstudio::conf(2019) took place last week. I (co-)taught a workshop
  and gave a talk there, so I needed a lot of time to make the preparation. In this
  post, I want to share some observations and experiences. Note that this is not a
  summary of the conference. Many others have blogged about the conference, and you
  can find those links in <a href=\"https://github.com/kbroman/RStudioConf2019Slides\">Karl&rsquo;s
